<h1>Hello.</h1>
</br>
</br>
This is a token about me page.
</br>
</br>
Well versed in design & product development* (wait, not the type you probably are thinking...), semi travelled** (I wouldn't say well, because it's never enough, is it?) and rather 
frustrated in the state of the world right now***, I had a brilliantly original thought during a lockdown:
</br>
</br>
"I'm going to learn a new skill!" (also bake banana bread & sourdough)
</br>
</br>
Turns out sourdough and I aren't the best of friends (too sour for my liking and a good crust eluded me like a cruel temptress, although I have just bought a dutch oven so let's revist 
sometime soon), thus I started a short course in coding and haven't looked back since. 
</br>
Learning to code has been a thoroughly enjoyable part of my pandemic life.

*By design & product development I mean the F word. FASHUN DAHLING
</br>
**I was a typical 2 year visa Australian going offshore to 'find & further herself' with a suitcase. And I am salty that I had to leave.

***Actual bloody understatment - who on earth isn't?!
